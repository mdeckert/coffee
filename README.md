# Coffee Roasting Toolkit for Skywalker Roaster

Complete toolkit for tracking, timing, and analyzing your coffee roasts.

## Quick Start

### RECOMMENDED: Use the Integrated Tool

```bash
python3 roast.py               # All-in-one timer + logger
```

**How it works:**
1. Answer: Decaf? (y/n) - that's it!
2. Complete pre-roast checklist (empty chaff, turn off cooling)
3. Press ENTER when you load beans â†’ timer starts with audio alerts
4. Press ENTER at first crack START â†’ log temperature
5. Press ENTER at first crack END â†’ log temperature (when you lower heat)
6. Press ENTER when you drop beans â†’ log end temps
7. Add notes and it auto-saves everything

### Analyze Your Progress

After logging roasts with roast.py:
```bash
python3 roast_stats.py         # View statistics and comparisons
```

## Files in This Toolkit

### âš¡ roast.py (RECOMMENDED)
**Integrated timer and logger - the easiest way to track your roasts**

**Features:**
- Real-time timer with automatic milestone alerts
- Three simple control points: Load beans, First crack, Drop beans
- Auto-logs all data to CSV
- No switching between tools during your roast

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 roast.py
```

**Control Flow:**
1. Enter bean info (origin, decaf/regular, batch size)
2. **Press ENTER** when you load beans (starts timer)
3. Timer runs with audio alerts at key times
4. **Press Ctrl+C** at first crack, enter temperature
5. Timer continues showing development time
6. **Press Ctrl+C** when dropping beans, enter temps
7. Add color notes and observations
8. Done! Data saved automatically

### ðŸ“Š roast_stats.py
**Statistical analysis of your roasting history**

**Features:**
- Compare decaf vs regular bean performance
- Track averages and consistency
- Identify trends over time
- Variance analysis

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 roast_stats.py
```

**Works with roast.py's CSV output** - analyzes all your logged roasts

### ðŸ“š SKYWALKER_GUIDE.md
Complete roasting guide for Colombian beans with your Skywalker roaster.

**Contents:**
- Temperature and timing profiles for regular and decaf beans
- Medium-dark roast targets
- Troubleshooting tips
- Cooling and resting guidelines
- Quick reference card

**Usage:** Open in vi or any text editor to reference during roasting

## Typical Workflow

### First Time Setup
1. Read `SKYWALKER_GUIDE.md` to understand your target profile
2. Prepare your beans and roaster

### Each Roast Session
1. **Pre-roast:** Review `SKYWALKER_GUIDE.md`, prepare beans
2. **Start:** Run `python3 roast.py`, answer decaf y/n, complete checklist
3. **Load beans:** Press ENTER â†’ timer starts with audio alerts
4. **First crack starts:** Press ENTER, log temperature
5. **First crack ends:** Press ENTER, log temperature (when you lower heat)
6. **Drop beans:** Press ENTER, log end temps and notes
7. **Done:** Data saved automatically to `roast_log.csv`

### Weekly/Monthly Review
1. Run `roast_stats.py` to analyze progress
2. Compare decaf vs regular performance
3. Check consistency metrics
4. Adjust technique based on data

## Tips for Success

### Data Collection
- **Log every roast** - even "bad" ones provide learning data
- **Be consistent** with timing - press ENTER at the same points each time
- **Add tasting notes** after rest period (edit CSV directly with vi)

### Using the Tools
- **Audio alerts** remind you to check key milestones
- **Stats show patterns** you might miss roast-to-roast
- **Decaf comparison** prevents treating decaf like regular beans
- **First crack tracking** helps dial in your temp reduction timing

## File Locations

All files in: `/Users/mdeckert/coffee/`

- `roast.py` - Integrated timer + logger (use this!)
- `roast_stats.py` - Analysis and statistics tool
- `SKYWALKER_GUIDE.md` - Roasting reference guide
- `roast_log.csv` - Your roast data (auto-created)
- `README.md` - This file

---

## Customization Ideas

### Change Bean Origin
Edit `roast.py` line 119 to change from "Colombian" to another origin.

### Adjust Alert Timings
Edit the `get_milestones()` function in `roast.py` (around line 278) to change when audio alerts sound.

### Change Audio Sound
Edit line 38 in `roast.py` - replace `Ping.aiff` with another sound from `/System/Library/Sounds/`

### Add Tasting Notes
After coffee has rested:
```bash
vi roast_log.csv
```
Find the roast row and add notes in the "Tasting Notes" column.

### Export Data
The CSV works with Excel, Google Sheets, or any analysis tool:
```bash
open roast_log.csv              # Opens in default app
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script won't run
Make sure it's executable:
```bash
chmod +x roast.py roast_stats.py
```

### Can't find roast_log.csv
It's created automatically when you complete your first roast with `roast.py`.

### Audio alerts not working
Check system volume. Alerts use macOS system sounds. Test with:
```bash
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff
```

### Want to reset data
Backup or delete `roast_log.csv` to start fresh:
```bash
mv roast_log.csv roast_log_backup.csv
```

## What Makes This Useful for Learning

1. **Structured data** - Compare roasts objectively, not just by memory
2. **Decaf tracking** - Understand how decaf differs from regular
3. **Consistency feedback** - Stats show if you're getting more consistent
4. **Pattern recognition** - See relationships between time/temp/results
5. **Reference guide** - No guessing about target temps and times

Good luck with your roasting! The more you log, the more useful the stats become.
