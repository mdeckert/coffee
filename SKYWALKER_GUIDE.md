# Skywalker Roaster - Colombian Coffee Guide

## Roasting 1 lb Batches: Medium-Dark Profile

### Pre-Roast Setup
- **Batch size**: 1 lb (16 oz) green coffee
- **Preheat**: 5 minutes recommended
- **Ambient temp**: Note weather/room temp (affects roast)
- **Airflow**: Start at medium, adjust as needed

## Temperature & Timing Guidelines

### Regular Colombian Beans (Medium-Dark)

| Phase | Time Range | Temp Range | What to Look For |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Drying/Yellowing** | 4-6 min | Up to 300°F | Grassy smell fades, beans turn yellow |
| **First Crack** | 8-10 min | 385-405°F | Audible popping, oils mobilizing |
| **Development** | 1.5-3 min | 405-430°F | Deep brown, rolling toward 2nd crack |
| **Drop Time** | 10-13 min | 420-435°F | Med-dark: just before/early 2nd crack |

**Total roast time**: 10-13 minutes for medium-dark

### Decaf Colombian Beans (Medium-Dark)

**IMPORTANT**: Decaf beans behave differently!

| Difference | Why | Adjustment |
|-----------|-----|------------|
| **Roast 1-2 min faster** | Lower density, pre-processing | Watch more carefully |
| **First crack earlier** | Often 7-9 min vs 8-10 min | Lower starting temp slightly |
| **Less pronounced cracks** | Softer structure | Rely more on color/smell |
| **Burns easier** | More fragile | Reduce heat after FC if needed |

**Total roast time**: 9-11 minutes for medium-dark decaf

## Skywalker-Specific Tips

### Heat Management
1. **Start medium-high**: Get beans moving quickly through drying
2. **Reduce before FC**: Drop heat 10-15% around 360°F to control FC
3. **Steady through development**: Maintain consistent temp rise (10-15°F/min)

### Airflow
- **High airflow**: Lighter roast, faster cooling, more acidity
- **Lower airflow**: Darker roast, more body, risk of baking
- **For med-dark**: Medium-high airflow, reduce slightly after FC

### Listen & Watch
- **First crack**: Sounds like popcorn, steady rolling for 60-90 seconds
- **Second crack**: Faster, sharper snaps (like Rice Krispies)
- **Medium-dark target**: Drop 15-30 seconds before 2nd crack OR just as it starts

## Key Temperature Markers

```
300°F  - End of yellowing, entering browning
330°F  - Maillard reactions ramping up
385°F  - First crack imminent (regular beans)
375°F  - First crack imminent (decaf beans)
405°F  - Development phase begins
420°F  - Medium roast territory
430°F  - Medium-dark sweet spot
440°F  - Approaching dark roast (2nd crack)
450°F+ - Dark/French roast (caution: fire risk)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Roast taking too long (>14 min)
- **Fix**: Increase starting temp or heat faster through drying

### Problem: Scorching/tipping on beans
- **Fix**: Too much heat too fast; gentler heat ramp

### Problem: Baked/flat flavor
- **Fix**: Stuck in drying phase too long; increase heat earlier

### Problem: Decaf tastes ashy
- **Fix**: Dropped too late; decaf needs earlier drop than regular

### Problem: Inconsistent roast color
- **Fix**: Agitation issue or heat distribution; check drum speed

## Cooling & Resting

1. **Cool FAST**: Get beans to room temp in 4-5 minutes
   - Use Skywalker cooling tray with fan
   - Stir/agitate during cooling

2. **Rest period**:
   - **Minimum**: 12 hours
   - **Optimal**: 24-48 hours for med-dark
   - **Peak flavor**: Days 2-7 after roasting

3. **Storage**:
   - Airtight container with one-way valve
   - Cool, dark place
   - Use within 2-3 weeks for peak freshness

## Notes Section

### Batch Comparison: Regular vs Decaf

Track these differences:
- Time to first crack
- Total roast time
- Drop temperature
- Flavor profile differences

### Your Skywalker's Personality

Every roaster is different. Note:
- Does your machine run hot/cold?
- Optimal airflow settings for your environment
- How altitude/humidity affects your roasts
